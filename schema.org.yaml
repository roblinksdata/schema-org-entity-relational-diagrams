    - 'A Global Trade Item Number ([GTIN](https://www.gs1.org/standards/id-keys/gtin)).
      GTINs identify trade items, including products and services, using numeric identification
      codes.


      A correct [[gtin]] value should be a valid GTIN, which means that it should
      be an all-numeric string of either 8, 12, 13 or 14 digits, or a \"GS1 Digital
      Link\" URL based on such a string. The numeric component should also have a
      [valid GS1 check digit](https://www.gs1.org/services/check-digit-calculator)
      and meet the other rules for valid GTINs. See also [GS1''s GTIN Summary](http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/technical/idkeys/gtin)
      and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Trade_Item_Number) for
      more details. Left-padding of the gtin values is not required or encouraged.
      The [[gtin]] property generalizes the earlier [[gtin8]], [[gtin12]], [[gtin13]],

      The GS1 [digital link specifications](https://www.gs1.org/standards/Digital-Link/)
      expresses GTINs as URLs (URIs, IRIs, etc.).

      Digital Links should be populated into the [[hasGS1DigitalLink]] attribute.


      Note also that this is a definition for how to include GTINs in Schema.org data,
      and not a definition of GTINs in general - see the GS1 documentation for authoritative
      details.'

    - 'The publishingPrinciples property indicates (typically via [[URL]]) a document
      describing the editorial principles of an [[Organization]] (or individual, e.g.
      a [[Person]] writing a blog) that relate to their activities as a publisher,
      e.g. ethics or diversity policies. When applied to a [[CreativeWork]] (e.g.
      [[NewsArticle]]) the principles are those of the party primarily responsible
      for the creation of the [[CreativeWork]].


      While such policies are most typically expressed in natural language, sometimes
      related information (e.g. indicating a [[funder]]) can be expressed using schema.org
      terminology.

      This title (or work) may have several variants, which EIDR calls \"edits\".
      See [[editEIDR]].


      Since schema.org types like [[Movie]], [[TVEpisode]], [[TVSeason]], and [[TVSeries]]

      in the outdoors, typically containing individual [[CampingPitch]] locations.
      \\n\\n

      In British English a campsite is an area, usually divided into a number of pitches,
      where people can camp overnight using tents or camper vans or caravans; this
      British English use of the word is synonymous with the American English expression
      campground. In American English the term campsite generally means an area where
      an individual, family, group, or military unit can pitch a tent or park a camper;
      a campground may contain many campsites (source: Wikipedia, see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campsite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campsite)).\\n\\n

  CreativeWorkSeries:
    comments:
    - "A CreativeWorkSeries in schema.org is a group of related items, typically but\
      \ not necessarily of the same kind. CreativeWorkSeries are usually organized\
      \ into some order, often chronological. Unlike [[ItemList]] which is a general\
      \ purpose data structure for lists of things, the emphasis with CreativeWorkSeries\
      \ is on published materials (written e.g. books and periodicals, or media such\
      \ as TV, radio and games).\\\\n\\\\nSpecific subtypes are available for describing\
      \ [[TVSeries]], [[RadioSeries]], [[MovieSeries]], [[BookSeries]], [[Periodical]]\
      \ and [[VideoGameSeries]]. In each case, the [[hasPart]] / [[isPartOf]] properties\
      \ can be used to relate the CreativeWorkSeries to its parts. The general CreativeWorkSeries\
      \ type serves largely just to organize these more specific and practical subtypes.\\\
      \\n\\\\nIt is common for properties applicable to an item from the series to\
      \ be usefully applied to the containing group. Schema.org attempts to anticipate\
      \ some of these cases, but publishers should be free to apply properties of\
      \ the series parts to the series as a whole wherever they seem appropriate.\n\

    comments:
    - A [[CriticReview]] is a more specialized form of Review written or published
      by a source that is recognized for its reviewing activities. These can include
      online columns, travel and food guides, TV and radio shows, blogs and other
      independent Web sites. [[CriticReview]]s are typically more in-depth and professionally
      written. For simpler, casually written user/visitor/viewer/customer reviews,
      it is more appropriate to use the [[UserReview]] type. Review aggregator sites
      such as Metacritic already separate out the site's user reviews from selected
      critic reviews that originate from third-party sources.

  EndorsementRating:
    comments:
    - 'An EndorsementRating is a rating that expresses some level of endorsement,
      for example inclusion in a \"critic''s pick\" blog, a

      \"Like\" or \"+1\" on a social network. It can be considered the [[result]]
      of an [[EndorseAction]] in which the [[object]] of the action is rated positively
      by

      some [[agent]]. As is common elsewhere in schema.org, it is sometimes more useful
      to describe the results of such an action without explicitly describing the
      [[Action]].


      An [[EndorsementRating]] may be part of a numeric scale or organized system,
      but this is not required: having an explicit type for indicating a positive,

      endorsement rating is particularly useful in the absence of numeric scales as
      it helps consumers understand that the rating is broadly positive.

    comments:
    - "A series of [[Event]]s. Included events can relate with the series using the\

      \ share some unifying characteristic. For example, \\\"The Olympic Games\\\"\
      \ is a series, which\nis repeated regularly. The \\\"2012 London Olympics\\\"\
      \ can be presented both as an [[Event]] in the series \\\"Olympic Games\\\"\
      , and as an\n[[EventSeries]] that included a number of sporting competitions\
      \ as Events.\n\nThe nature of the association between the events in an [[EventSeries]]\
      \ can vary, but typical examples could\ninclude a thematic event series (e.g.\
      \ topical meetups or classes), or a series of regular events that share a location,\
      \ attendee group and/or organizers.\n\nEventSeries has been defined as a kind\
      \ of Event to make it easy for publishers to use it in an Event context without\n\
      worrying about which kinds of series are really event-like enough to call an\
      \ Event. In general an EventSeries\nmay seem more Event-like when the period\
      \ of time is compact and when aspects such as location are fixed, but\nit may\
      \ also sometimes prove useful to describe a longer-term series as an Event.\n\

    comments:
    - The causative agent(s) that are responsible for the pathophysiologic process

      condition, symptom or sign. The proximate cause is defined as the causative
      agent that most directly results in the medical condition, symptom or sign.
      For example, the HIV virus could be considered a cause of AIDS. Or in a diagnostic
      context, if a patient fell and sustained a hip fracture and two days later sustained
      a pulmonary embolism which eventuated in a cardiac arrest, the cause of the
      cardiac arrest (the proximate cause) would be the pulmonary embolism and not
      the fall. Medical causes can include cardiovascular, chemical, dermatologic,
      endocrine, environmental, gastroenterologic, genetic, hematologic, gynecologic,
      iatrogenic, infectious, musculoskeletal, neurologic, nutritional, obstetric,

      all of type :Protein. A protein can thus be a subclass of another protein, e.g.
      :Protein as a UniProt record can have multiple isoforms inside it which would
      also be :Protein. They can be imagined, synthetic, hypothetical or naturally

  SpecialAnnouncement:
    comments:
    - "A SpecialAnnouncement combines a simple date-stamped textual information update\n\
      \      with contextualized Web links and other structured data.  It represents\
      \ an information update made by a\n      locally-oriented organization, for\
      \ example schools, pharmacies, healthcare providers,  community groups, police,\n\
      \      local government.\n\nFor work in progress guidelines on Coronavirus-related\
      \ markup see [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ikaGCKxo50rRM7nvKSlbUpjyIk2WMQd3IkB1lItlrM/edit#).\n\
      \nThe motivating scenario for SpecialAnnouncement is the [Coronavirus pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic),\
      \ and the initial vocabulary is oriented to this urgent situation. Schema.org\n\
      expect to improve the markup iteratively as it is deployed and as feedback emerges\
      \ from use. In addition to our\nusual [Github entry](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2490),\
      \ feedback comments can also be provided in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fpdFFxk8s87CWwACs53SGkYv3aafSxz_DTtOQxMrBJQ/edit#).\n\
      \n\nWhile this schema is designed to communicate urgent crisis-related information,\
      \ it is not the same as an emergency warning technology like [CAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Alerting_Protocol),\
      \ although there may be overlaps. The intent is to cover\nthe kinds of everyday\
      \ practical information being posted to existing websites during an emergency\
      \ situation.\n\nSeveral kinds of information can be provided:\n\nWe encourage\
      \ the provision of \\\"name\\\", \\\"text\\\", \\\"datePosted\\\", \\\"expires\\\
      \" (if appropriate), \\\"category\\\" and\n\\\"url\\\" as a simple baseline.\
      \ It is important to provide a value for \\\"category\\\" where possible, most\
      \ ideally as a well known\nURL from Wikipedia or Wikidata. In the case of the\
      \ 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, this should be \\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2019-20\\\
      \\_coronavirus\\\\_pandemic\\\" or \\\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81068910\\\
      \".\n\nFor many of the possible properties, values can either be simple links\
      \ or an inline description, depending on whether a summary is available. For\
      \ a link, provide just the URL of the appropriate page as the property's value.\
      \ For an inline description, use a [[WebContent]] type, and provide the url\
      \ as a property of that, alongside at least a simple \\\"[[text]]\\\" summary\
      \ of the page. It is\nunlikely that a single SpecialAnnouncement will need all\
      \ of the possible properties simultaneously.\n\nWe expect that in many cases\
      \ the page referenced might contain more specialized structured data, e.g. contact\
      \ info, [[openingHours]], [[Event]], [[FAQPage]] etc. By linking to those pages\
      \ from a [[SpecialAnnouncement]] you can help make it clearer that the events\
      \ are related to the situation (e.g. Coronavirus) indicated by the [[category]]\
      \ property of the [[SpecialAnnouncement]].\n\nMany [[SpecialAnnouncement]]s\
      \ will relate to particular regions and to identifiable local organizations.\
      \ Use [[spatialCoverage]] for the region, and [[announcementLocation]] to indicate\
      \ specific [[LocalBusiness]]es and [[CivicStructure]]s. If the announcement\
      \ affects both a particular region and a specific location (for example, a library\
      \ closure that serves an entire region), use both [[spatialCoverage]] and [[announcementLocation]].\n\
      \nThe [[about]] property can be used to indicate entities that are the focus\
      \ of the announcement. We now recommend using [[about]] only\nfor representing\
      \ non-location entities (e.g. a [[Course]] or a [[RadioStation]]). For places,\
      \ use [[announcementLocation]] and [[spatialCoverage]]. Consumers of this markup\
      \ should be aware that the initial design encouraged the use of [[about]] for\
      \ locations too.\n\nThe basic content of [[SpecialAnnouncement]] is similar\
      \ to that of an [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) or [Atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard))\
      \ feed. For publishers without such feeds, basic feed-like information can be\
      \ shared by posting\n[[SpecialAnnouncement]] updates in a page, e.g. using JSON-LD.\
      \ For sites with Atom/RSS functionality, you can point to a feed\nwith the [[webFeed]]\
      \ property. This can be a simple URL, or an inline [[DataFeed]] object, with\
      \ [[encodingFormat]] providing\nmedia type information, e.g. \\\"application/rss+xml\\\
      \" or \\\"application/atom+xml\\\".\n"

  StatisticalPopulation:
    comments:
    - 'A StatisticalPopulation is a set of instances of a certain given type that
      satisfy some set of constraints. The property [[populationType]] is used to
      specify the type. Any property that can be used on instances of that type can
      appear on the statistical population. For example, a [[StatisticalPopulation]]
      representing all [[Person]]s with a [[homeLocation]] of East Podunk California
      would be described by applying the appropriate [[homeLocation]] and [[populationType]]
      properties to a [[StatisticalPopulation]] item that stands for that set of people.

      The properties [[numConstraints]] and [[constraintProperty]] are used to specify
      which of the populations properties are used to specify the population. Note
      that the sense of \"population\" used here is the general sense of a statistical

      population, and does not imply that the population consists of people. For example,
      a [[populationType]] of [[Event]] or [[NewsArticle]] could be used. See also
      [[Observation]], where a [[populationType]] such as [[Person]] or [[Event]]
      can be indicated directly. In most cases it may be better to use [[StatisticalVariable]]
      instead of [[StatisticalPopulation]].'

  StatisticalVariable:
    comments:
    - '[[StatisticalVariable]] represents any type of statistical metric that can
      be measured at a place and time. The usage pattern for [[StatisticalVariable]]
      is typically expressed using [[Observation]] with an explicit [[populationType]],
      which is a type, typically drawn from Schema.org. Each [[StatisticalVariable]]
      is marked as a [[ConstraintNode]], meaning that some properties (those listed
      using [[constraintProperty]]) serve in this setting solely to define the statistical
      variable rather than literally describe a specific person, place or thing. For
      example, a [[StatisticalVariable]] Median_Height_Person_Female representing
      the median height of women, could be written as follows: the population type
      is [[Person]]; the measuredProperty [[height]]; the [[statType]] [[median]];
      the [[gender]] [[Female]]. It is important to note that there are many kinds
      of scientific quantitative observation which are not fully, perfectly or unambiguously
      described following this pattern, or with solely Schema.org terminology. The
      approach taken here is designed to allow partial, incremental or minimal description
      of [[StatisticalVariable]]s, and the use of detailed sets of entity and property
      IDs from external repositories. The [[measurementMethod]], [[unitCode]] and
      [[unitText]] properties can also be used to clarify the specific nature and
      notation of an observed measurement. '

  SuperficialAnatomy:
    comments:
    - Anatomical features that can be observed by sight (without dissection), including
      the form and proportions of the human body as well as surface landmarks that
      correspond to deeper subcutaneous structures. Superficial anatomy plays an important
      role in sports medicine, phlebotomy, and other medical specialties as underlying
      anatomical structures can be identified through surface palpation. For example,
      during back surgery, superficial anatomy can be used to palpate and count vertebrae
      to find the site of incision. Or in phlebotomy, superficial anatomy can be used
      to locate an underlying vein; for example, the median cubital vein can be located
      by palpating the borders of the cubital fossa (such as the epicondyles of the
      humerus) and then looking for the superficial signs of the vein, such as size,
      prominence, ability to refill after depression, and feel of surrounding tissue
      support. As another example, in a subluxation (dislocation) of the glenohumeral
      joint, the bony structure becomes pronounced with the deltoid muscle failing
      to cover the glenohumeral joint allowing the edges of the scapula to be superficially
      visible. Here, the superficial anatomy is the visible edges of the scapula,
      implying the underlying dislocation of the joint (the related anatomical structure).

      type makes it easier to describe Web-addressable content without requiring such
      distinctions to always be stated. (The intent is that the existing types [[WebPage]],
      [[WebSite]] and [[WebPageElement]] will eventually be declared as subtypes of
      [[WebContent]].)

    - Indicates the kind of product that this is a variant of. In the case of [[ProductModel]],
      this is a pointer (from a ProductModel) to a base product from which this product
      is a variant. It is safe to infer that the variant inherits all product features
      from the base model, unless defined locally. This is not transitive. In the
      case of a [[ProductGroup]], the group description also serves as a template,
      representing a set of Products that vary on explicitly defined, specific dimensions
      only (so it defines both a set of variants, as well as which values distinguish
      amongst those variants). When used with [[ProductGroup]], this property can
      apply to any [[Product]] included in the group.

  iso6523Code:
    comments:
    - An organization identifier as defined in [ISO 6523(-1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_6523).
      The identifier should be in the `XXXX:YYYYYY:ZZZ` or `XXXX:YYYYYY`format. Where
      `XXXX` is a 4 digit _ICD_ (International Code Designator), `YYYYYY` is an _OID_
      (Organization Identifier) with all formatting characters (dots, dashes, spaces)
      removed with a maximal length of 35 characters, and `ZZZ` is an optional OPI
      (Organization Part Identifier) with a maximum length of 35 characters. The various
      components (ICD, OID, OPI) are joined with a colon character (ASCII `0x3a`).
      Note that many existing organization identifiers defined as attributes like
      [leiCode](https://schema.org/leiCode) (`0199`), [duns](https://schema.org/duns)
      (`0060`) or [GLN](https://schema.org/globalLocationNumber) (`0088`) can be expressed
      using ISO-6523. If possible, ISO-6523 codes should be preferred to populating
      [vatID](https://schema.org/vatID) or [taxID](https://schema.org/taxID), as ISO
      identifiers are less ambiguous.

      \ In most cases, it would be pointless and counter productive to attempt to\

      \ The property is intended for the case when items (primarily [[Product]] and\
      \ [[Offer]]) have extra URLs hosted on an additional \\\"mobile site\\\" alongside\
      \ the main one. It should not be taken as an endorsement of this publication\
